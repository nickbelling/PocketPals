        This is the browser source for the game "Order Up" as shown on Back
        Pocket's "Pocket Pals".

        Start the game by browsing to this game.html file with a "decade"
        parameter, e.g. "game.html?decade=90"
        
        Next to game.html are four directories, "90s", "00s", "10s" and "20s",
        representing a set of games for each decade. Inside each of those
        directories is a "games.js" file, which adds a list of games to a global
        object on this page called "games".

        Each "games.js" file includes an array of games for that decade, with a
        name and date of release. The "name" is used to load the images - we
        assume that next to the file defining that object is a file called
        "[name]logo.png", and another file called "[name]bg.png". For example,
        the game object for "The Sims" looks like this:

        {
            "name": "thesims",
            "date": "2000 - Feb 4"
        }

        This assumes that next to the games.js file, there is a file called
        "thesimsbg.png" and "thesimslogo.png".

        Further explanation of how the logic for the game works is in the
        "interactivity.js" file loaded at the end.
