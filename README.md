# Pocket Pals

This repository contains all of the custom code used in the production of Season
2 of Back Pocket's Pocket Pals and is designed to be supplementary material for
the video "How I Did It: Pocket Pals".

In this repo you'll find the custom Adobe ExtendScript code as well as various
Python & Windows Batch scripts, organised by game. Python code requiring
external dependencies are always accompanied by a `requirements.txt`.
